## Project Information

Portals is a framework written in Scala under the **Apache 2.0 License** for stateful serverless applications.

The Portals framework aims to unify the distributed dataflow streaming model with the actor model, providing flexibility, data-parallel processing capabilities and strong guarantees. The framework is designed to be used in a serverless environment, where the user can focus on the business logic of the application, while the framework takes care of the infrastructure and failure management.

Key features:
* Multi-dataflow applications: define, connect and compose multiple dataflows into complex services.
* Inter-dataflow services, the Portal service abstraction: expose/connect to/from dataflows as services.
* Decentralized cloud/edge execution: API primitives for connecting runtimes, and deploying on edge/cloud devices.

> **Note**
> Disclaimer: Portals is a research project under development and not yet ready for production use.

## Project Status and Roadmap

The Portals project is currently in the early stages of development. We are working towards a first release, which in addition to the current state, will include a distributed, decentralized runtime. We have planned a release for this fall 2023. Besides these new developments, we have a stable Scala API, JS API, Interpreter, Benchmarks, and Examples.

> **Note**
> Features that are currently in development are marked as *experimental* and are likely to change.

## Project Setup

To use Portals in your project, add the following dependecy to your `build.sbt` file:

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.portals-project" %% "portals" % "0.1.0-RC1"
```

A full project setup with instructions for executing a hello world example is available at [https://github.com/portals-project/Hello-World](https://github.com/portals-project/Hello-World).

> **Note**
> Portals has not yet been published to Maven Central. The Portals Project can be published locally using the `sbt publishLocal` command. To use Portals in your project, import the local snapshot instead: `libraryDependencies += "org.portals-project" %% "portals-core" % "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"`.

## Getting Started Guide

We recommend the following steps to get started.
* [Install Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org/download/), we recommend working with sbt, together with [Metals](https://scalameta.org/metals/docs/editors/vscode/) on VS Code. 
* Clone the [Hello World](https://github.com/portals-project/Hello-World) repository.
* Compile and run the project `sbt compile;`, `sbt run;`.
* To get some inspiration, check out the [examples](/portals-examples) or read the [tutorial](https://www.portals-project.org/learn/tutorial).

### Examples

The Portals library comes with an API for defining multi-dataflow applications, and a serverless runtime for executing these applications. The most basic example would involve defining a `workflow` and a `generator` within the context of a `PortalsApp`, and executing this on the test runtime interpreter. 

```scala
import portals.api.dsl.DSL.*
import portals.system.Systems
object HelloWorld extends App:
  val app = PortalsApp("HelloWorld"):
    val generator = Generators.fromList(List("Hello World!"))
    val workflow = Workflows[String, String]()
      .source(generator.stream)
      .map(_.toUpperCase())
      .logger()
      .sink()
      .freeze()
  val system = Systems.test()
  system.launch(app)
  system.stepUntilComplete()
  system.shutdown()
```
